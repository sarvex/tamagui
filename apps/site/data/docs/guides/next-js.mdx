description: How to set up Tamagui with Next.js
---

You should run `npm create tamagui` which bootstraps a very nicely configured Next.js app where you can take or leave whatever you want.

Also check out the [source for this site](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/apps/site) to see a good example of a full featured Next.js website as well, especially the `next.config.js` and `tamagui.config.ts`.

### next.config.js

To configure Tamagui for Next.js, you'll want to add the `@tamagui/next-plugin` and set it up in your next config. See the [compiler install docs](/docs/intro/compiler-install) for more options:

```tsx
module.exports = function (name, { defaultConfig }) {
  let config = {
    ...defaultConfig,
    // ...your configuration
  }

  const tamaguiPlugin = withTamagui({
    config: './tamagui.config.ts',
    components: ['tamagui'],
  })

  return {
    ...config,
    ...tamaguiPlugin(config),
  }
}
```

### \_document.tsx

You'll want to set up a `_document.tsx` and gather both the `react-native-web` style object using AppRegistry, as well as Tamagui styles using `Tamagui.getCSS()` into the head element.

<Notice>
  Make sure the Tamagui style tag always comes after the `getStyleElement` style tag to
  ensure Tamagui styles override built-in `react-native-web` ones.
</Notice>

Note that we only are importing `react-native` here because if you use `tamagui` views like Input or Image they rely on React Native Image/Input (and therefore on the web, `react-native-web`). If you are just using core, or aren't using Image or Input in `tamagui`, you can forego the entire `AppRegistry` import and setup here. We're working on making even `tamagui` completely de-coupled from RN/RNW by building their own image and input components eventually.

```tsx
import NextDocument, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
import { Children } from 'react'
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native'

import Tamagui from '../tamagui.config'

export default class Document extends NextDocument {
  static async getInitialProps({ renderPage }) {
    AppRegistry.registerComponent('Main', () => Main)
    const page = await renderPage()
    // @ts-ignore
    const { getStyleElement } = AppRegistry.getApplication('Main')
    const styles = [
      getStyleElement(),
      <style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: Tamagui.getCSS() }} />,
    ]
    return { ...page, styles: Children.toArray(styles) }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}
```

### Themes

We've created a package that works with Tamagui to properly support SSR light/dark themes that also respect user system preference, called `@tamagui/next-theme`. It assumes your `light`/`dark` themes are named as such, but you can override it. This is pre-configured in the create-tamagui starter.

We recommend memo-ing children so they don't re-render. Here's how you'd set up your `_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import { NextThemeProvider, useRootTheme } from '@tamagui/next-theme'
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import Head from 'next/head'
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react'
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from '../tamagui.config'

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useRootTheme()

  // memo to avoid re-render on dark/light change
  const contents = useMemo(() => {
    return <Component {...pageProps} />
  }, [pageProps])

  // because we do our custom getCSS() above, we disableInjectCSS here
  return (
    <>
      <Head>{/* ... */}</Head>
      <NextThemeProvider onChangeTheme={setTheme}>
        <TamaguiProvider
          config={config}
          disableInjectCSS
          disableRootThemeClass
          defaultTheme={theme}
        >
          {contents}
        </TamaguiProvider>
      </NextThemeProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

If you need to access the current theme, say for a toggle button, you will then use the `useTheme` hook. We'll release an update in the future that makes this automatically work better with Tamagui's built-in `useTheme`.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@tamagui/next-theme'

export default () => {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme()
  return <Button>Change theme (currently: {theme})</Button>
}
```

### Mount animations

Animations that run through JS drivers and have `enterStyle` set will want to add the following script that allows for hiding those animations before the JS runs. This is the "right way" to handle things, as it allows for disabling JS entirely and not accidentally hiding all unmounted things. Meanwhile, it still properly avoids a flash of mounted style for SSR pages.

Add this to your `_app.tsx` render output:

```tsx
<NextHead>
  <script
    key="tamagui-animations-mount"
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      // avoid flash of animated things on enter
      __html: `document.documentElement.classList.add('t_unmounted')`,
    }}
  />
</NextHead>
```

### Server components

Tamagui includes Server Components support for the Next.js app directory. It should work fully server side eventually, but we have to work with the Next.js team to figure out the final steps here. Until then, `use client` support is here already.

In your `app/layout.tsx` add this:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useServerInsertedHTML } from 'next/navigation'
import React, { useState } from 'react'

import { Tamagui } from './tamagui.config'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  useServerInsertedHTML(() => {
    // this first time this runs you'll get the full CSS including all themes
    // after that, it will only return CSS generated since the last call
    return <>{Tamagui.getNewCSS()}</>
  })

  return children
}
```

The new `getNewCSS` helper in Tamagui will keep track of the last call and only return new styles generated since the last usage.
