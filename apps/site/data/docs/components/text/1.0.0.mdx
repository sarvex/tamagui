<HeroContainer demoMultiple>
  <TextDemo />

```tsx hero template=Text

```

  features={[
    'Themes that give you control over spacing, weights, and sizes custom to each font.',
    'Size prop that automatically matches all theme values.',
    'Media query styles, hoverStyle, pressStyle, focusStyle.',

### Usage

Text in Tamagui matches to Text in react-native-web, just with the added [Tamagui Props](/docs/intro/props).

It explicitly doesn't inherit your theme color or other font properties, as it's meant to be plain and used for extension. Below, we'll show `SizableText` which extends Text, and `Paragraph` which extends SizableText. Generally, Paragraph is the useful view as it will use theme values, while you can extend Text if you'd like to derive your own design system.

```tsx
import { Text, XStack, YStack } from 'tamagui'

export default () => (
  <>
    <Text
      // can add theme values
      color="$white"
      fontFamily="$body"
      // or just use direct values
      fontSize={20}
      hoverStyle={{
        color: '$colorHover',
      }}
    >
      Lorem ipsum
    </Text>
  </>
)
```

## SizableText

One unique feature to Tamagui that doesn't exist in many UI kits is that your themes define font sizing, spacing, line height, and letter spacing - all - custom for each font. This gives you the necessary control to have beautiful fonts with the right styles without having to resort to ugly hacks.

SizableText does this with the `size` property, which looks into your theme and sets the following, so long as the keys for each value match:

- fontSize
- lineHeight
- fontWeight
- letterSpacing

It uses [spread variants](/docs/core/styled#spread-variants) to achieve this.

[Seeing how SizableText is defined](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/text/src/SizableText.tsx) is helpful for understanding Tamagui. They serve as a good example of how you can extend and compose components.

## Paragraph

Finally Paragraph extends `SizableText` and simply makes the text selectable, which is a property from the Text props that sets `userSelect` to `true` and `cursor` to `text`:

```tsx
export const Paragraph = styled(SizableText, {
  name: 'Paragraph',
  userSelect: 'auto',
})
```

<Notice>
  Note: Paragraph renders to a `p` tag on web, which can cause issues when you nest them
  during SSR. If you don't mind rendering to a span, use `SizableText`, otherwise, be
  careful when nesting items inside a Paragraph.
