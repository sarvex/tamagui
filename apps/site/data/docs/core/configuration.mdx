Create a `tamagui.config.ts` in the root of your app to set up your design system. It should only be imported by the top-level file that runs `React.render`, to ensure fast refresh works.

## Quick Start

You can use `@tamagui/config` a totally complete config out of the box, the same one this site uses.

```tsx
import { config } from '@tamagui/config'
import * as ReactNative from 'react-native'
import { createTamagui, setupReactNative } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

// if using only @tamagui/core with `react-native` components
// if using `tamagui` this isn't necessary
setupReactNative(ReactNative)

const appConfig = createTamagui(config)

export type AppConfig = typeof appConfig

declare module '@tamagui/core' {
  // overrides TamaguiCustomConfig so your custom types
  // work everywhere you import `tamagui`
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}
}

export default appConfig
```

[The source](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/config/src/tamagui.config.ts) and [type output](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/config/types/tamagui.config.d.ts) of that config is also useful as a reference for building your own custom config.

---

Another quick start that gives a bit more customization is using `@tamagui/shorthands` for our preset shorthands, and `@tamagui/themes` for the same themes and tokens used for this site. Then you'll just want to bring along any fonts, media queries, and animations you need.

```tsx
import { shorthands } from '@tamagui/shorthands'
import { themes, tokens } from '@tamagui/themes'
import { createTamagui } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

const appConfig = createTamagui({
  themes,
  tokens,
  shorthands,
})

export type AppConfig = typeof appConfig

declare module '@tamagui/core' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}
}

export default appConfig
```

Depending on if you're using just `@tamagui/core`, `tamagui`, or your own custom design library, be sure the import of `createTamagui` and `declare module` type matches to the one you're using.

## Overview

Let's start with an example of a complete `tamagui.config.ts` which is in the code block below. Note that keys used here can be customized to your liking, but using them in combination with [shorthands](#shorthands) give you a nice syntax like this:

```tsx
<XStack bg="$red" w="$2" h="$1" />
```

And if you want even shorter, like this:

```tsx
<Box bg-red w-2 h-1 />
```

You can achieve that by writing variants (see [an example at bottom of page](#example-of-shorthands-an-variants)).

```tsx
import { createMedia } from '@tamagui/react-native-media-driver'
import { createFont, createTamagui, createTokens } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

const interFont = createFont({
  family: 'Inter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  // keys used for the objects you pass to `size`, `lineHeight`, `weight`
  // and `letterSpacing` should be consistent. The `createFont` function
  // will fill-in any missing values if `lineHeight`, `weight` or `letterSpacing`
  // are subsets of `size`
  size: {
    1: 12,
    2: 14,
    3: 15,
  },
  lineHeight: {
    // 1 will be 22
    2: 22,
  },
  weight: {
    1: '300',
    // 2 will be 300
    3: '600',
  },
  letterSpacing: {
    1: 0,
    2: -1,
    // 3 will be -1
  },
  // (native) swap out fonts by face/style
  face: {
    300: { normal: 'InterLight', italic: 'InterItalic' },
    600: { normal: 'InterBold' },
  },
})

// these keys can be different, but again we highly recommend consistency
const size = {
  0: 0,
  1: 5,
  2: 10,
  // ....
}

export const tokens = createTokens({
  size,
  space: { ...size, '-1': -5, '-2': -10 },
  radius: { 0: 0, 1: 3 },
  zIndex: { 0: 0, 1: 100, 2: 200 },
  color: {
    white: '#fff',
    black: '#000',
  },
})

const config = createTamagui({
  fonts: {
    // for tamagui, heading and body are assumed
    heading: interFont,
    body: interFont,
  },
  tokens,
  themes: {
    light: {
      bg: '#f2f2f2',
      color: tokens.color.black,
    },
    dark: {
      bg: '#111',
      color: tokens.color.white,
    },
  },

  // `@tamagui/core` doesn't provide media query capabilities out of the box
  // for native as it is de-coupled from react-native.

  // For web-only, media queries work out of the box and you can avoid the
  // `createMedia` call here by passing the media object directly.

  // If targeting React Native, add this driver and `createMedia` call.
  // `tamagui` and `config` do this for you automatically.
  media: createMedia({
    sm: { maxWidth: 860 },
    gtSm: { minWidth: 860 + 1 },
    short: { maxHeight: 820 },
    hoverNone: { hover: 'none' },
    pointerCoarse: { pointer: 'coarse' },
  }),

  // optional:

  // add custom shorthand props
  // note: as const in important, without it you may see breaking types
  shorthands: {
    px: 'paddingHorizontal',
    f: 'flex',
    w: 'width',
  } as const,

  // Experimental / advanced, only for overriding the core component styles
  // Prefer to use styled() for building your own, only useful for edge cases.
  defaultProps: {
    Text: {
      // override any default props here
    },
  },
})

type AppConfig = typeof config

// this will give you types for your components
// note - if using your own design system, put the package name here instead of tamagui
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}
}

export default config
```

The `createTamagui` function receives a configuration object:

- `tokens`: Use `createTokens` to generate variables in your theme and app.
- `theme`: Define your design [theme](/docs/intro/themes), which map to CSS properties.
- `media`: Define reusable responsive [media queries](/docs/use-media).
- `shorthands`: Define any props you want to expand to style values, keys being the shorthand and values being the expanded style prop.
- `defaultProps`: For more advanced uses, you can override all named `styled()` components initial values. These merge downwards, so `styled(Text, { name: 'Paragraph' })` will get any defaultProps set for `Text`.
- `onlyAllowShorthands` when set to true will ensure that if you define shorthands, they override existing long-form style props.

Note, for `tamagui` (not core), it expects you to define a `true` token that maps to your default size, this way it knows what token to use by default. So you'd do something like this:

```tsx
export const tokens = createTokens({
  size: {
    small: 20,
    medium: 30,
    true: 30, // note true = 30 just like medium, your default size token
    large: 40,
  },
  space: {
    small: 10,
    medium: 20,
    true: 20, // same goes for space and other token categories
    large: 30,
  },
})
```

<Notice>
  The compiler will parse your tamagui.config.ts file at build-time. For this reason, we
  recommend keeping it relatively simple. Don't import heavy dependencies, and prefer to
  import `createTamagui` and other helpers directly from @tamagui/core.
</Notice>

### Add Provider

Import and use the Tamagui `Provider` component at the top component in your app.

```tsx line=3-5
import { TamaguiProvider } from 'tamagui'

import config from './tamagui.config'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <TamaguiProvider config={config}>
      <AppContents />
    </TamaguiProvider>
  )
}
```

#### Using Tamagui Provider

TamaguiProvider takes a few optional properties:

<PropsTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'defaultTheme',
      required: true,
      type: 'string',
      description: `The initial top level theme.`,
    },
    {
      name: 'disableRootThemeClass',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description:
        'Disable inserting a theme class in the DOM or context, allowing you to manually place it higher. For custom use cases like integration with next-theme.',
    },
    {
      name: 'disableInjectCSS',
      required: false,
      type: 'boolean',
      description: `By default Tamagui inserts CSS with a useLayoutEffect on load. But if you're setting up SSR you'll want to use getCSS() on the server instead and then turn on this setting.`,
    },
  ]}
/>

If you use `disableInjectCSS`, you'll need to use this somewhere to insert your CSS into head:

```tsx
import Tamagui from './tamagui.config'

const css = Tamagui.getCSS()
// insert into your head
```

If using Next.js, see how to do this in the [Next.js guide](/docs/guides/next-js), there are also docs for app directory and RSC support.

<Notice>
  Make sure the style tag you insert with the `getCSS` styles is inserted after any
  `react-native-web` style tags to ensure Tamagui can override the built-in styles.
</Notice>

### Setup media query driver

`@tamagui/core` doesn't provide media capabilities out of the box to native apps, while on the web it uses native media queries. To enable media queries for React Native, you need to provide matchMedia implementation:

```sh
yarn add @tamagui/react-native-media-driver
```

```tsx
import { createMedia } from '@tamagui/react-native-media-driver'

export default createTamagui({
  media: createMedia({
    xs: { maxWidth: 660 },
    // ...
  }),
})
```

## Tokens

Tokens have a structure inspired by but divergent from the [Theme UI spec](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec/). They are mapped to CSS variables at build time.

### Font tokens

The font tokens are a bit special and are created with `createFont`:

```tsx
const interFont = createFont({
  family: 'Inter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  size: {
    1: 12,
    2: 14,
    3: 15,
    // ...
  },
  lineHeight: {
    1: 17,
    2: 22,
    3: 25,
    // ...
  },
  weight: {
    4: '300',
    6: '600',
  },
  letterSpacing: {
    4: 0,
    8: -1,
  },

  // for native only, alternate family based on weight/style
  face: {
    // pass in weights as keys
    700: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
    800: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
    900: { normal: 'InterBold', italic: 'InterBold-Italic' },
  },
})
```

<Notice>
  Note, you don't need to use numbered keys, you can use `sm` or `tiny` or whatever you'd
  like. But you do want keep those keys consistent.
</Notice>

This gives you a lot of power over customizing every aspect of your design based on each font family. In other styling libraries that follow the Theme UI spec, you generally don't group your size/lineHeight/weight/etc tokens by the family, which means you are forced to choose a single vertical rhythm no matter the font.

Things to note:

- The keys of `size`, `lineHeight`, `weight`, and `letterSpacing` are meant to match.
- Define the full set of keys on `size`, the rest can be a subset.
- Missing keys from partially defined objects will be filled in.
  - In the example above, `weight` is only defined at `4` and `6`.
  - At creation Tamagui fills in the missing keys with previous value, or the next one if no previous exists. So weight `1` === `300`, weight `5` === `300`, and weight `7` === `600`.

---

### Non-font tokens

The rest of the tokens categories besides font are flatter. The `space` and `size` generally share keys, and that space can generally use negative keys as well.

```tsx
// passed into createTamagui
const tokens = createTokens({
  color: {
    white: '#fff',
    black: '#000',
  },
})
```

You access tokens then by using `$` prefixes in your values. Tamagui knows which tokens to use based on the style property you use.

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <Text fontSize="$lg" lineHeight="$lg" fontFamily="$mono" color="$white">
    Hello world
  </Text>
)
```

One final note: using tokens with themes. Tokens are considered a "fallback" to themes, so any values you define in your theme will override the token. The next section will explain this further.

### Strict tokens

If you'd like to enforce _only_ allowing token values from your theme, you can override the `ThemeValueFallback` type in tamagui in your existing `tamagui.config.ts` like so:

```tsx
declare module 'tamagui' {
  interface TamaguiCustomConfig extends AppConfig {}

  // add this:
  interface ThemeValueFallback {
    value: never
  }
}
```

This will change all special style properties that map to token/theme values to not accept strings or numbers. If you want to make exceptions, you can then add back in any general types by overriding one of the following: `SizeTokens`, `FontTokens`, `FontSizeTokens`, `FontLineHeightTokens`, `FontWeightTokens`, `FontLetterSpacingTokens`, `FontStyleTokens`, `FontTransformTokens`, `SpaceTokens`, `ColorTokens`, and `ZIndexTokens`.

### Themes

Themes live one level below tokens. Tokens are your variables, where themes use those tokens to create consistent, generic properties that you then typically use in shareable components. Themes should generally only deal with colors.

Tamagui components in general expect a set of theme keys to be defined like the following, but you can deviate if you create your own design system.

```tsx
const light = {
  background: '#fff',
  backgroundHover: tokens.color.gray2,
  backgroundPress: tokens.color.gray4,
  backgroundFocus: tokens.color.gray5,
  backgroundTransparent: tokens.color.grayA1,
  borderColor: tokens.color.gray4,
  borderColorHover: tokens.color.gray6,
  borderColorPress: tokens.color.gray12,
  borderColorFocus: tokens.color.gray11,
  color: tokens.color.gray10,
  colorHover: tokens.color.gray9,
  colorPress: tokens.color.gray8,
  colorFocus: tokens.color.gray8,
  shadowColor: tokens.color.grayA4,
  shadowColorHover: tokens.color.grayA6,
  shadowColorPress: tokens.color.grayA8,
  shadowColorFocus: tokens.color.grayA8,
  ...lightColors,
}
```

You don't have to use tokens as your theme values, but if you do they avoid some overhead. With Tamagui, the idea is that `bg`, `color`, and `borderColor` represent the "primary" and clearest colors, and `bg2`, `color2` etc get more subtle.

To see how it works, here's a snippet from `InteractiveFrame` which is the frame component that's used in `Button`:

```tsx
export const InteractiveFrame = styled(XStack, {
  borderRadius: '$1',
  paddingVertical: '$2',
  paddingHorizontal: '$3',
  backgroundColor: '$background',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  cursor: 'pointer',
  flexWrap: 'nowrap',
  flexDirection: 'row',
  flexShrink: 1,

  hoverStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundHover',
  },

  pressStyle: {
    backgroundColor: '$backgroundPress',
  },

  // ...
})
```

### Media

For more full docs on media queries, see the [useMedia docs page](/docs/core/use-media).

### Animations

Choose one of `@tamagui/animations-css`, `@tamagui/animations-react-native` or `@tamagui/animations-reanimated`. Note that `reanimated` support is not as well supported.

Append a new key `animations` to your `createTamagui` call:

```tsx
import { createAnimations } from '@tamagui/animations-react-native'

// pass this exported `animations` to your `createTamagui` call:
export const animations = createAnimations({
    bouncy: {
      damping: 9,
      mass: 0.9,
      stiffness: 150,
    },
    lazy: {
      damping: 18,
      stiffness: 50,
    },
  }),
})
```

If you want to have different drivers for each platform, like a CSS driver for the web and react-native for native, simply use the React Native convention of having platform-specific files: add a `animations.ts` and `animations.native.ts`. Set them up just like above, with matching keys, but importing from their respective driver.

### Shorthands

Shorthands are defined directly on your `createTamagui` call, rather than being attached to each component, to de-couple shorthands from components. This forces component kits to standardize on the basic react-native style syntax and ensures there's only one set of abbreviations defined ever.

Here's an example of a partial shorthands configuration:

```tsx
// the as const ensures types work with the optional `onlyAllowShorthands` option
const shorthands = {
  ac: 'alignContent',
  ai: 'alignItems',
  als: 'alignSelf',
  bblr: 'borderBottomLeftRadius',
  bbrr: 'borderBottomRightRadius',
  bc: 'backgroundColor',
  br: 'borderRadius',
  btlr: 'borderTopLeftRadius',
  btrr: 'borderTopRightRadius',
  f: 'flex',
  // ...
} as const

export default createTamagui({
  shorthands,
})
```

For a full configuration, see [@tamagui/shorthands](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/packages/shorthands/src/index.tsx)
