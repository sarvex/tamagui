  Style more consistently, easily, and performantly while sharing typed tokens, themes,
  fonts and more across both React Native and Web.

The highest level part of Tamagui is `tamagui` itself, a complete UI kit built on top of `@tamagui/core`. This gives you a huge amount of progress towards a beautiful, fully working app consisting of some of the hardest components to get right, all done in a way that gives you control over their styling.

## `@tamagui/core`

After [configuring](/docs/core/configuration), use `@tamagui/core` as simply as:

```tsx
import { Stack, Text } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const App = () => (
  <Stack backgroundColor="red" borderRadius={10}>
    <Text color="white">Hello</Text>
  </Stack>
)
```

Core also includes a `styled` utility with a `variants` field that is a very quick way to author
props by letting you quickly type both the key and the value of the prop you expect:

```tsx
import { Stack, Theme, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const AvatarCircle = styled(Stack, {
  // use direct values
  backgroundColor: '#000',

  // or use values typed in createTamagui() themes and tokens
  shadowColor: '$color2',

  pressStyle: {
    scale: 1.05,
  },

  variants: {
    pin: {
      floating: {
        position: 'absolute',
        top: '$xs',
        left: '$xs',
      },
    },

    featured: {
      true: {
        scale: 1.1,
        borderRadius: 12,
      },
    },
  } as const,
})

export const App = () => (
  <Theme name="light">
    <AvatarCircle pin="floating" featured />
  </Theme>
)
```

Variants can also take functions to catch either all values or specific types of tokens you define in your themes.

You can nest styled components multiple times:

```tsx
import { Stack, styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

export const SizedHorizontal = styled(Stack, {
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: {
        minWidth: 44,
        height: 44,
      },
      lg: {
        minWidth: 68,
        height: 68,
      },
    },
  },
})

export const SizedButton = styled(SizedHorizontal, {
  tag: 'button',

  variants: {
    disabled: {
      true: {
        backgroundColor: '#ccc',
        pointerEvents: 'none',
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Tamagui has the nice feature of fully-deterministic rendering based on the order of their definition, where the last key of the style object wins. This works both on props and styled() calls:

```tsx
import { styled } from 'tamagui' // or '@tamagui/core'

import { SizedButton } from './example-above'

const HeroButton = styled(SizedButton, {
  // bigger border, of course
  borderWidth: 4,
  size: 'lg',

  variants: {
    outlined: {
      true: {
        backgroundColor: 'transparent',
        borderColor: 'black',
      },
    },
  },
})

export default (props) => (
  <HeroButton
    outlined
    // overrides the borderColor in outlined
    borderColor="red"
    // props can override
    {...props}
    // eg if props = { outlined: true }, borderColor is black again
    borderRadius={12}
    // borderRadius is *always* 12
  />
)
```

This works across the Web and Native with the full typed APIs of React Native, with additional web-only API's and escape hatches that make it a great experience no matter if you're targeting Native only, Native and Web, or Web only.

#### Design System

Using [createTamagui](/docs/core/configuration) you can generate a fully-typed design system with colors, tokens, spacing, sizing, fonts, themes, shorthands, animations, and more, that work with well-optimized and easy to use hooks like [useMedia](/docs/core/use-media) and [useTheme](/docs/core/use-theme).

## `@tamagui/static`

The `@tamagui/static` package is an optimizing compiler for React that does much more than just extracting CSS styles. It significantly speeds up the runtime of apps by flattening your styled views as their call-sites, handling even tricky dynamic styles there, and outputting a `div` (on the web) or `View` (on native).

There's a lot to it, and good reasons it exists, but are [discussed more on the compiler introduction](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler).

## `tamagui`

Above that, [the Tamagui UI Kit](/docs/components/stacks) for building full-featured app interfaces right out of the box. Featuring powerful, themeable components that scale across every size in your design system. Enjoy Radix-like composable component APIs that always visually adapt properly to each platform.
